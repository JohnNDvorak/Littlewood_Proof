## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Aristotle files | 58 |
| Sorry-free files | 0 |
| Files with sorries | 58 |
| Total sorries | 17 |
| Critical blockers resolved | 6/7 |
| Remaining blocker | Hardy only! |

## Priority Actions for Morning

1. **Check Aristotle queue for Hardy's theorem** - This is the LAST BLOCKER
2. Integrate any returned proofs using _incoming/README.md checklist
3. Review AutoWiringAnalysis.md for potential quick wins
4. Continue with remaining sorries if no Hardy yet

## Files Generated Overnight

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SorryDetails/*.txt | Detailed sorry contexts for each file |
| TheoremCatalog.md | All 200+ theorems/lemmas available |
| WiringOpportunities.md | Sorries and what might close them |
| ImportAudit.md | Non-Mathlib imports by file |
| DefinitionXRef.md | All definitions, potential conflicts |
| AutoWiringAnalysis.md | Analysis of which sorries are wireable |
| HypothesisStatus.md | Hypothesis class instances |
| Statistics.md | Complete project metrics |
| AllBridges.lean | Master bridge import file |
| _incoming/README.md | Aristotle integration checklist |

## Critical Path Reminder

```
Hardy's Theorem (⏳ WAITING)
    ↓
∃ infinitely many ρ with Re(ρ) = 1/2
    ↓
psi_as_trig_sum has nonzero coefficients
    ↓
trigPoly_zero_iff_coeffs_zero
    ↓
Schmidt oscillation theorem
    ↓
ψ(x) - x oscillates
    ↓
π(x) - li(x) = Ω±(√x / log x)
    ↓
LITTLEWOOD'S 1914 THEOREM! 🎉
```

## Notes

- Build is clean (warnings only, no errors)
- AllBridges.lean compiles successfully
- All actively imported Aristotle files compile
- Documentation fully updated
