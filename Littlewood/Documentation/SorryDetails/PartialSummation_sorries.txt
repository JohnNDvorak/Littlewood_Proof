This follows from the decomposition:
  π(x) - li(x) = (ψ(x) - x)/log(x) - T(x) + ∫₂ˣ (ψ(t) - t)/(t log²t) dt + 2/log(2)

Since T(x) = O(x^{1/2}/log(x)) and the integral term is dominated by the main term,
if ψ(x) - x oscillates with amplitude Ω(x^{1/2}), then π(x) - li(x) oscillates too.

  -- The decomposition shows that the dominant term is (ψ(x) - x)/log(x)
  -- When ψ(x) - x is large positive/negative, so is π(x) - li(x)
  -- The error terms T(x) and the integral are smaller order
