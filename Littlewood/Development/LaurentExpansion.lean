# Laurent Expansion of -ζ'/ζ

The logarithmic derivative -ζ'/ζ has a Laurent expansion near s = 1:
  -ζ'(s)/ζ(s) = 1/(s-1) + γ + O(|s-1|)

where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

`riemannZeta_residue_one : Tendsto (fun s ↦ (s - 1) * riemannZeta s) (𝓝[≠] 1) (𝓝 1)`

This establishes that ζ(s) has a simple pole at s = 1 with residue 1.
Consequently, -ζ'/ζ(s) = -d/ds[log ζ(s)] has a simple pole at s = 1 with residue 1.

The full Laurent expansion -ζ'/ζ(s) = 1/(s-1) + γ + O(|s-1|) requires
extracting the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ, which needs more infrastructure.

#check riemannZeta_residue_one

/-- Laurent expansion of -ζ'/ζ near s = 1.

The pole at s = 1 with residue 1 comes from the simple pole of ζ(s) at s = 1.
The constant term γ (Euler-Mascheroni) comes from the expansion.

BLOCKED: Requires detailed local expansion analysis not readily available in Mathlib.

    ∃ (h : ℂ → ℂ), AnalyticAt ℂ h s ∧

  -- The pole at s = 1 with residue 1 comes from Mathlib's riemannZeta_residue_one
  -- Need to extract Laurent coefficients from the local expansion
  sorry -- BLOCKED: Laurent expansion infrastructure

/-- Simplified: -ζ'/ζ has a simple pole at s = 1 with residue 1.

This follows from ζ having a simple pole with residue 1.
