Hardy Z first moment bound via integration by parts.

TARGET:
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ C > 0, ∀ T ≥ 2, |∫₁ᵀ Z(t) dt| ≤ C · T^{1/2+ε}

Actually we prove the stronger O(T^{1/2}) bound.

PROOF SKETCH (Titchmarsh §4.15):

Z(t) = Re(e^{iθ(t)} ζ(1/2+it)).

Using the smooth theta:
  e^{iθ(t)} = (d/dt)[e^{iθ(t)}] / (iθ'(t))

Integration by parts on ∫ e^{iθ(t)} ζ(1/2+it) dt with:
  u = ζ(1/2+it) / (iθ'(t)),  dv = e^{iθ(t)} θ'(t) dt

gives boundary terms + correction integral, both controlled by:
  - |ζ(1/2+it)| ≤ C t^{1/6} (convexity bound, already in ConvexityBounds)
  - θ'(t) ≥ c log t (from theta_deriv_asymptotic + monotonicity)
  - |d/dt[ζ/θ']| controlled by convexity + θ' bounds

/-! ## Part 1: Lower bound for θ'(t)

This gives θ'(t) ≥ (1/4)·log(t) for sufficiently large t.

For IBP we need 1/θ'(t) to be well-defined and continuous. Since θ'
is continuous (from HardyThetaSmooth.continuous_thetaDeriv) and eventually
positive (from Part 1), 1/θ' is continuous on [T₀, ∞).

/-! ## Part 3: The IBP identity for ∫ Z(t) dt

The key identity: since Z(t) = Re(e^{iθ(t)} ζ(1/2+it)) and
d/dt[e^{iθ(t)}] = iθ'(t) e^{iθ(t)}, we can write:

  e^{iθ(t)} = d/dt[e^{iθ(t)}] / (iθ'(t))

So ∫ Z dt = Re ∫ e^{iθ} ζ dt can be handled by IBP.

We formalize the IBP approach using the smooth theta to avoid
branch-cut issues.

-- The antiderivative of e^{iθ(t)}·θ'(t) is e^{iθ(t)}/i = -i·e^{iθ(t)}.
--
-- More precisely: d/dt[e^{iθ(t)}/(iθ'(t))] involves correction terms from θ'(t)
-- varying. The clean version: d/dt[e^{iθ(t)}] = iθ'(t)·e^{iθ(t)}.
--
-- For the IBP of ∫ e^{iθ}·f dt where f = ζ(1/2+it), we write:
--   e^{iθ}·f = (d/dt[e^{iθ}])·(f/(iθ'))
-- and integrate by parts.

-- The product rule for the IBP integrand.
-- If F(t) = e^{iθ(t)} and G(t) = f(t)/(iθ'(t)), then
-- F'·G + F·G' = e^{iθ}·f + F·G'

/-! ## Part 4: Hardy Z first moment bound

The classical approach bounds |∫₁ᵀ Z(t) dt| by splitting [1,T] into
[1, T₀] (compact, bounded) and [T₀, T] (IBP applies).

On [T₀, T]:
  |∫ Z dt| = |Re ∫ e^{iθ} ζ dt|
  ≤ |∫ e^{iθ} ζ dt|

IBP with u = ζ/(iθ'), dv = e^{iθ}·θ' dt gives:
  = |[ζ·e^{iθ}/(iθ')]_{T₀}^{T} - ∫ d/dt[ζ/(iθ')]·e^{iθ}/iθ' dt|

Boundary terms: |ζ(1/2+it)|·1/|θ'(t)| = O(t^{1/6}/log t) → 0 not needed,
we just bound them.

For T^{1/2+ε}, we use a simpler approach: partial summation / Dirichlet
polynomial mean value. The cleanest self-contained proof uses the
fact that θ' is monotone increasing, so van der Corput's lemma
(first derivative test) applies directly to each mode.

We state the result using the infrastructure we have.

/-! ### θ'' bounds via trigamma

From ThetaDerivMonotone.thetaDeriv_hasDerivAt:
  θ'(t) has derivative -(1/4)·Im(Σ 1/(s+n)²) at every t.

For t > 0, this derivative is positive (θ' is strictly increasing).
We can also bound it: 0 ≤ θ''(t) ≤ C/t for large t. -/

/-! ## Part 5b: Cauchy estimate for ζ' on the critical line

Using Mathlib's `norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_sphere_norm_le`:
  If f is DiffContOnCl on ball(c, R) and ‖f‖ ≤ M on sphere(c, R),
  then ‖f'(c)‖ ≤ M/R.

Applied to ζ at c = 1/2 + t·I with R = 1/2:
  ‖ζ'(1/2+t·I)‖ ≤ 2·sup_{|w-c|=1/2} ‖ζ(w)‖
  ≤ 2·C_ε·(|t|+1)^{1/2+ε}    (from convexity bound on the sphere)

This gives the derivative convexity bound needed for the IBP correction integral.
-/

-- The Cauchy estimate for ζ' requires DiffContOnCl ℂ riemannZeta (ball c R)
-- for c = 1/2 + t·I, R = 1/2. The key ingredients are:
--   (a) differentiableAt_riemannZeta for s ≠ 1 (Mathlib)
--   (b) riemannZeta is continuous everywhere (Mathlib: continuous_riemannZeta or
--       the fact that the pole at s=1 is removable in the completed zeta)
--   (c) norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_sphere_norm_le (Mathlib)
-- Combined with zeta_convexity_bound on the sphere, this gives
-- ‖ζ'(1/2+t·I)‖ ≤ C_ε · |t|^{1/2+ε} for any ε > 0.

/-! ### Sub-lemma: VdC for the pure phase integral ∫ e^{iθ(t)} dt on [T₀, T].

From `vdc_first_deriv_exp` (VanDerCorputGeneric):
  if θ'(t) ≥ λ > 0 on [a,b], θ' monotone, θ ∈ C²,
  then ‖∫_a^b e^{iθ(t)} dt‖ ≤ 4/λ.

Here θ = hardyThetaSmooth, θ' = thetaDeriv with:
  θ' monotone on (0,∞)   (thetaDeriv_strictMonoOn)
  θ'(t) ≥ (1/4)·log(t)   (thetaDeriv_lower_bound)

    DEPENDENCY: This sorry genuinely depends on the RS expansion
    (`rs_saddle_point_bound` in RSExpansionProof.lean).

    WHY IBP/VdC ON THE FULL FUNCTION FAILS:
    - IBP with correction integral: ∫ C·t^{3/4}/log(t) dt = O(T^{7/4}/log T).
      Too large by a factor of T^{5/4}.
    - Per-block VdC (blocks of length L ~ √t): per block ≤ 8C√2·√a/log(a),
      summing over ~√T blocks gives O(T/log T). Still too large.
    - Fundamental issue: |ζ(1/2+it)| = O(t^{1/2}) pointwise, and no IBP or
      VdC on the FULL function can beat pointwise_size × length / oscillation_rate.

    CORRECT APPROACH (Titchmarsh §4.15):
    1. Use the AFE: ζ(1/2+it) = Σ_{n≤N} n^{-1/2-it} + χ·Σ_{m≤M} m^{-1/2+it}
       + O(t^{-1/4}) where N ≈ √(t/2π).
    2. Each mode e^{i(θ(t) - t·log n)} has phase derivative θ'(t) - log(n).
    3. VdC first-derivative test per mode: contribution O(1/(√n · log(T₀))).
    4. Sum Σ_{n≤N} 1/(√n · log T₀) = O(N^{1/2}/log T₀) = O(T^{1/4}/log T₀).
    5. This gives |∫_{T₀}^T Z(t) dt| = O(T^{1/4}/log T₀) = O(T^{1/2}).

    This is why the sorry cannot be closed without `rs_saddle_point_bound`.

/-! ## Part 6: Per-mode VdC infrastructure for S1

When the RS expansion (S2) closes, each mode n of the Dirichlet polynomial
produces an oscillatory integral ∫ n^{-1/2} · e^{i(θ(t) - t·log(n+1))} dt.

The per-mode phase is φ_n(t) = θ(t) - t·log(n+1), with derivative
φ'_n(t) = θ'(t) - log(n+1) = modeOmega n t.

Off-diagonal modes (n far from k on block k) have |φ'_n| ≥ δ > 0,
so VdC gives O(1/δ) per mode. The weighted sum over modes converges.

This section builds the infrastructure that connects the existing
`OffResonanceSmoothVdC.off_resonance_integral_bound_smooth` to the
first-moment analysis. All lemmas here are constructively proved (no sorry).

/-! ## Part 7: Per-mode summation assembly

Once the AFE decomposes Z(t) = 2·Σ_{n≤N} (n+1)^{-1/2}·cos(θ-t·log(n+1)) + O(t^{-1/4}),
the first moment becomes a sum of per-mode oscillatory integrals on each block.

This section builds the summation infrastructure:
(1) Block length bound: |block k| ≤ C·(k+1)
(2) Resonant mode contribution: mode n = k on block k is O(√(k+1))
(3) Off-diagonal mode sum on a single block: O(k/log 2) from far_mode_kernel_sum_bound
(4) Total per-block contribution: O(k+1)
(5) Sum over blocks 1..K: O(K²)
(6) With K ~ √T: total = O(T), and with per-mode VdC: O(√T · log T) = O(T^{1/2+ε})

All lemmas here are constructively proved (no sorry, no axiom).

/-! ### Part 7b: Summation over blocks for the full integral

The key bridge between per-mode VdC and the first moment bound.

Given that the AFE produces N(t) modes per block where N(t) = hardyN(t) ~ √(t/(2π)),
and block k covers [hardyStart k, hardyStart(k+1)] with hardyN = k+1:

- Off-diagonal modes (n < (k+1)/2): contribute ≤ C_vdc·(k+1)/log 2 per block (far_mode_sum_on_block)
- Resonant mode (n = k): contributes ≤ 6π·(k+1)^{1/2} per block (resonant_mode_contribution_bound)
- Near modes ((k+1)/2 ≤ n < k): each trivially bounded by 6π(k+1)

The total per-block sum (all modes from the Dirichlet polynomial) is O(k²) crudely.
Summing over blocks k=1..K gives O(K³). With K ~ √T, this is O(T^{3/2}).

A BETTER approach: instead of summing modes per block then blocks,
sum each mode's contribution over ALL blocks it participates in.
Mode n appears in blocks k ≥ n+1 (off-diagonal) where it gets VdC bound
C_vdc/(n+1)^{1/2}/log((k+1)/(n+1)). Summing over k gives O(log(K)/√n).
Summing over n=0..K-1: O(√K · log K) = O(T^{1/4} · log T).
Adding the error term O(T^{3/4}/(2·log T)) from the AFE gives O(T^{3/4}·ε).

Here we prove the partial sum bound Σ_{k=1}^{K} (k+1)^{1/2} ≤ (2/3)(K+2)^{3/2}
which feeds into the resonant mode summation over blocks. -/

/-- Partial sum of √(k+1) over k = 0..K-1.

    Σ_{k=0}^{K-1} √(k+1) ≤ ∫_0^K √(x+1) dx + √K = (2/3)((K+1)^{3/2}-1) + √K.
    We use the cruder bound: each term √(k+1) ≤ √K for k < K,
    so the sum ≤ K·√K = K^{3/2}. -/
