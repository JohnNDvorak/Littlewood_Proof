    This removes the pole and gives an analytic function. -/

    This follows from ζ having a simple pole with residue 1. -/

  -- Near s = 1: ζ(s) ~ 1/(s-1), so log ζ(s) ~ -log(s-1)
  -- Thus ζ'/ζ ~ -1/(s-1), and -ζ'/ζ ~ 1/(s-1)
  -- So (s-1) * (-ζ'/ζ) → 1 as s → 1
  -- BLOCKED: Requires riemannZeta_residue_one and logarithmic derivative computation
  sorry

  sorry
