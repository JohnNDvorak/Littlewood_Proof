# Smoothed Explicit Formulas

This file develops smoothed versions of the explicit formula, which are
technically easier to work with and essential for Littlewood's proof.

## Main Results

* `psiSmoothed_explicit` : Explicit formula for ψ_k
* `cesaro_mean_formula` : Cesàro mean of ψ - x

## References

* Montgomery-Vaughan, "Multiplicative Number Theory I", Section 15.1
